/**
 * What became of the repairs that ran in the background.
 *
 * An ad-hoc task disappears from {task_adhoc} the moment it succeeds, so the
 * queue alone can only ever answer "what is still pending". An administrator
 * who queued a repair and comes back later sees an empty queue and cannot
 * tell whether it ran, what it changed, or whether it failed and was retried
 * away — which is why issue #6 asks for the outcome, not just the state.
 *
 * Kept as a bounded list in plugin config rather than a table of its own. A
 * rolling window of the last few dozen repairs is operational feedback, not
 * data anyone reports on, and it does not justify a schema, an upgrade step
 * and a privacy provider entry. The cap is what keeps that defensible: the
 * value can never grow beyond it, however often repairs run.
