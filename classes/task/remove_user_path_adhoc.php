/**
 * Deletes a user's local_adele_path_user record — but only once the reason
 * for it has proved durable.
 *
 * That row is the ONLY copy of the user's learning history: node progress,
 * completion state, manual overrides set by teachers, and the first_enrolled
 * timestamp that timed windows hang off. Deleting it the instant the last
 * carrying enrolment disappears is right for a genuine departure and
 * catastrophic for a blip — and the observer cannot tell the two apart at the
 * moment the event fires. A cohort resync, an accidental removal undone
 * seconds later, a bulk tool rebuilding memberships: each of those fires
 * user_enrolment_deleted and used to destroy months of progress, after which
 * re-enrolment handed the user a fresh, empty snapshot.
 *
 * Waiting settles it without touching the data model at all. When this task
 * runs it re-asks the same question the observer asked; if the user is
 * carried again by then, the deletion simply does not happen and the snapshot
 * was never in danger. If they are still not carried, the departure was real
 * and the row goes.
 *
 * Access revocation is deliberately NOT deferred: the observer purges the
 * enrolments immediately, because withdrawing access is correct and wanted
 * the moment entitlement ends. Only the destruction of history waits.
 *
 * That split leaves one gap this task has to close itself. For the length of
 * the wait the user path record is still active, so any recompute happening
 * in that window — a course completion, a node update, the nightly sweep —
 * legitimately re-enrols the user the observer just purged. If the departure
 * then turns out to be real, those re-created enrolments would survive the
 * deletion of the record and only be caught by the NEXT sweep, and then only
 * as a suspension. So whenever this task does delete the record, it purges
 * again. Both purges are idempotent; the second one is usually a no-op.
