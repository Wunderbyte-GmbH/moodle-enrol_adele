 *
 * Saving an activity changes who is entitled to the host course — a
 * deselected subscription option, a narrowed visibility mode, or the removal
 * of the activity altogether all revoke access that used to be justified.
 * None of that reached existing participants before: the live observers only
 * fire on enrolment events, so a settled cohort would have waited for the
 * next nightly sweep, and a deleted activity was never cleaned up at all.
 *
 * Queued rather than run inline because a popular host course can hold
 * thousands of enrolments and saving a form must not block on them. The
 * operation is idempotent, so a duplicate queue entry costs nothing.
