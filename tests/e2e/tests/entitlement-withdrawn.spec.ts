/**
 * entitlement-withdrawn - the withdrawal half of the central E2E contract
 * (plan section 27).
 *
 *     the course leaves the learning path
 *     -> the entitlement it carried ends
 *     -> the enrolment goes
 *     -> the learner can no longer open the course
 *
 * The chain follows what an author actually has to do, including the step
 * that fails: removing the entry node leaves its successor pointing at a
 * predecessor that no longer exists, and the editor REFUSES to save. That
 * refusal is part of the test - a silent save there would be the defect.
 * Only after the orphaned access condition is removed does the save go
 * through, and only then may the entitlement change.
 *
 * Afterwards the path itself is deleted, and that too must take its
 * entitlements with it.
 *
 * The negative control is unusually strong here, because all four fixture
 * paths start with the same course: changing ONE path must move the access
 * of that path's learner and of nobody else. A sweep that clears the course
 * for everybody would pass a test that only looked at the first learner.
