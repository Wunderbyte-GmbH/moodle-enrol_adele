/**
 * entitlement-to-course-access - the release half of the central E2E
 * contract (plan section 27).
 *
 *     condition met
 *     -> node accessible
 *     -> enrolment active
 *     -> the learner can open the course
 *
 * And its counterpart, which is what actually makes the chain a test: a
 * locked node must NOT produce access, and a person who is on no path must
 * not receive the effect at all (plan section 2 G).
 *
 * Runs on the reference path "Linear A1" (T01 -> T02 -> T03) from the shipped
 * fixtures. On that path only T01 is reachable at the start, which is exactly
 * the boundary this spec needs: one course that must open and one that must
 * not, for the same learner at the same moment.
